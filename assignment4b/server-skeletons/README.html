<hr> <h3>Reactive Microservices Image Processing Server App (Assignment 4b)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java functional programming features and their integration with Java
reactive streams and reactive microservices.  In particular, for this
assignment you'll develop a server app that uses the <A
HREF="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</A> implementation
of reactive streams in Spring <A
HREF="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html">WebFlux</A>
to create microservices that receive images from clients and return
updated images after applying requested transforms.</p>

<p> The code you'll write for the server app does not have its own
GUI.  Instead, it is accessed via an Android <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignment4a/client-skeletons">client
app</a> that can either perform all image processing locally on the
client device or remotely using the reactive microservices implemented
in this assignment that are deployed on one or more servers. Please
use this Android client app along with the unit tests discussed below
to help evaluate and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>A detailed overview of Java reactive streams (and a comparison
with Java streams) is available <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2SEcl1aMM">here</A>.  </li>
<p>

<li>A tutorial overview of Spring WebFlux and its support for reactive
microservices based on Project Reactor appears <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webflux">here</A>.  </li> </ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube CS253 playlist <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4uV6IgyjGNH9U-Tx-9c4LN">here</A>. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The reactive microservices image processing server app is packaged
as a project using the latest version of <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download"">IntelliJ</A>.  This
app is written in Java and demonstrates many Spring WebFlux
capabilities.  For the purposes of this assignment, however, you only
need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/">src/main/java/server</A>, whose <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/main/">main</A> and <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common">microservices/common</A>
folders contain the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="src/test/java">src/test/java</A>, which is a set of unit tests
that exercise key features in the server and can be used to evaluate
whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can start all the microservices that are part of this project by
clicking the green "Run 'Microservices'" button or by starting each
microservice independently via the IntelliJ IDE .</P>

<hr width=50% align=left>
<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/">src/main/java/server</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/MainController.java">MainController.java</A>
and <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/MainService.java">MainService.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods that implement an
app gateway entry point for remote clients that want an image to be
processed by a set of image transforms via Project Reactor
<code>Mono</code> and <code>Flux</code> classes.  </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common/TransformController.java">TransformController.java</A>
and <A
HREF="src/main/java/server/microservices/common/TransformService.java">TransformService.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods that implement a
microservice entry point that transforms the image by applying a
transform operation thereby producing a new modified image that is
then returned to the client via Project Reactor classes.  </P>

</UL>

<p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or (unnecessary)
conditional statements in this assignment and instead use Project
Reactor <CODE>Flux</CODE> and <CODE>Mono</CODE> class
operators. Likewise, there should be no calls to
<code>block()</code>. Your solution will be considered correct if it
passes all the unit tests and communicates properly with the Android
client app. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS253/tree/master/assignments/assignment4b/server-skeletons/">here</a>
in my GitHub account.  You can pull this skeleton code in your
repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="src/test/java">src/test/java</A> folder
are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  As usual, testing only
demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely
solely on the unit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> This assignment is more complicated than the previous assignments
since it requires deeper knowledge of Project Reactor and remote
communication via Spring WebFlux.  In particular, the asynchronous
nature of reactive streams and WebFlux may take some time to get
accustomed to, so please start the assignment soon and ask questions
in class, office hours, and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the
reactive microservices image processing server app skeletons and unit
tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to
complete your solution successfully. </p>
